    <p>This project's source code has been provided by the IBM Corporation. Here's an overview of the work done:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Budget.js:</strong></li>
        <li>
            In Budget.js, I utilized the useState hook to create a state variable called newBudget, initialized with the current value of budget. The value of newBudget is updated using the handleBudgetChange function when the user modifies the input field.
        </li>
        <li>
            I adjusted the value attribute of the input field to newBudget and added an onChange event listener to invoke handleBudgetChange when the input field value is altered.
        </li>
        <li>
            Additionally, I utilized Bootstrap Alert classes to style the component, providing a visually appealing gray background, inserting text, and setting a value manually.
        </li>
    </ul>
