    <p>This project's source code has been provided by the IBM Corporation and I have done the following works:</p>
    <ul>
        Budget.js:
        
        In Budget.js, I have used the useState hook to create a state variable named newBudget and initialized it with the current value of budget. I have also changed the value of newBudget with a function called handleBudgetChange when the user modifies the input field.
        
        Next, I have adjusted the value attribute of the input field to newBudget and incorporated an onChange event listener that invokes handleBudgetChange when the user alters the input field's value.
        
        Here, I have utilized the Bootstrap Alert classes to create a visually appealing gray background, inserted text, and manually set a value.
    </ul>
