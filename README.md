# Alloc8 ðŸ’¸ - Master Your Budget with Ease

# Overview

Welcome to **Alloc8** â€“ a smart and intuitive budget allocation app. This project was originally based on source code provided by IBM, but I have made several enhancements and modifications to get it up and running smoothly. Alloc8 helps you manage your finances by tracking your budget and expenses in real time. Itâ€™s built using React and leverages a clean and straightforward user interface.
